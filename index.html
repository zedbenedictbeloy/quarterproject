			<h2> What is Environmental Science? </h2>
			<br>
			<p> 
			Environmental science is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physics, biology, and geography 
			(including ecology, chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science, geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science) 
			to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment.
			Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.
			
			Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. 
			Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.
			
			In common usage, "environmental science" and "ecology" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other as well as how they interrelate with environment. 
			Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or public health issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. 
			In practice, there are considerable similarities between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists. 
			There is substantial overlap between ecology and environmental science with the disciplines of fisheries, forestry, and wildlife.

			<h2> Why is Environmental Science? </h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			Environmental Science is a multifaceted interdisciplinary study of how we humans interact with the living and non-living parts of the natural world. 
			The three main goals of environmental science are: to learn how the natural world works, to understand how humans interact with the environment, and to find ways to deal with environmental problems and live more sustainably.
			Employment of environmental scientists is projected to continue to grow in the coming decades. 
			Heightened public awareness in environmental issues, as well as the increasing demands placed on the environment by population growth, are expected to spur demand for environmental scientists and specialists.

			<h2> How is Environmental Science? </h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			Environmental Science provides an overview of how science affects our environment. 
			We focus on interactions between the solid Earth, its water, its air and its living organisms, and on dynamic, interdependent relationships between these four components.
			Earth and environmental scientists also consider how these relationships produce environmental change at different timescales. 
			To do this, they combine knowledge, models and methods drawn from geology, biology, physics and chemistry.
			We also strive to understand past and present environmental processes so that reliable and scientifically based predictions can be made about the future.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Environmental scientists conduct research to identify, control, or eliminate sources of pollutants or hazards affecting the environment or public health.
			
			Their research typically involves;
			
			Determining data collection methods,
			Collecting and analyzing air, water, and soil samples,
			Analyzing environmental data gathered by others,
			Looking for correlations to human activity,
			and Preparing reports and presentations that explain their findings.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Some environmental specialists focus on environmental issues while others focus on issues relating to human health. 
			Either way, they work on critical issues, solving some of the most important problems of our day.
			
			Environmental scientists also;
			Develop plans to prevent, control, or fix environmental problems like air pollution,
			Advise government officials that make policy,
			Help businesses follow regulations or improve their practices,
			Conduct environmental inspections of businesses,
			and Assess the potential effects of development projects to prevent the creation of new problems.
